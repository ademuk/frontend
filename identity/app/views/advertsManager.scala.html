            <h2 class="identity-title identity-title--small">Advertising</h2>
            <p>From the very first edition of The Guardian in 1821, our journalism has been funded in part by advertising. Unlike many news organisations, we haven’t put up a paywall. Instead, our journalism is funded by a combination of reader support and advertising revenue.  Our journalism is not influenced by the advertising we display and our journalists are free to, and often do, challenge the activities of companies and organisations that advertise and sponsor content that appears in Guardian sites and publications.</p>

            <p>As you browse our site, some of the cookies and similar technology we place on your device are for advertising, so we can understand what sort of pages you read and are interested in. We can then display advertising on your browser based on these interests. For instance if you have been reading a lot of food and drink articles, you may be shown more adverts for food and drink.</p>
